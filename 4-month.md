## Colin’s Ideal Routine (4 months)

### Morning Cycle[^1]

* 8:00: wake → feed[^2] → playtime
* 9:00: nap[^3]

### Midday Cycle

* 11:45: wake → feed → playtime
* 1:15: nap

### Afternoon Cycle

* 3:30: wake → feed → playtime
* 5:00: nap

### Evening Cycle

* 6:45: wake → feed → playtime
* 7:30: bedtime routine[^4]
* 8:00: bedtime
* 9:45: dream feed[^5]

[^1]: **Cycles:** We aim for four ~3hr 45min cycles, measured from the start of one feeding to the start of the next. Wake times range from 1-1.5 hours. These cycles are flexible, depending on how he’s doing throughout the day, and we occasionally end up with an extra cycle.

[^2]: **Feeding:**

  * Feed right when he wakes up, after a diaper change.
  * We aim for 6+ ounces, but 5-7 is fine. If he’s refusing with less (he’ll push the bottle out with his tongue), try again in 10 minutes.
  * Sometimes his head moves everywhere, and his hands are all over the bottle, incidentally pushing it away. This does not mean he’s finished eating. Persist!
  * Size 1 nipples work best during the daytime. The number is faintly printed on the side of the nipple.
  * Try burping after he finishes eating. It usually goes best when he’s upright against your chest.

[^3]: **Naptime:**

  * Usually he goes down easy, but sometimes he’ll cry. We give him 15 minutes of crying before we go check on him; he often settles himself down after 5-7 minutes.
  * If he wakes up and it’s been less than three hours since his last feeding, give him a chance to settle himself back down. If he doesn’t after 10 minutes or so, go in and rock him a bit. If he still doesn’t go back to sleep, it’s okay to start a new cycle.
  * If it’s been more than three hours since his last feeding and it doesn’t look like he’ll settle himself back down, go ahead and start a new cycle.

[^4]: **Bedtime Routine:** Give him a bath/rinse, put on an overnight diaper (blue and green polka dots) and pajamas, read two stories, then put him down.

[^5]: **Dream Feed:** We give Colin more food to get him through the night without waking up. Quietly get him out of the crib without waking him, sit somewhere comfortable, and feed him. Use a size 2 nipple so you aren’t sitting for awhile. Stroke his cheek to keep him moving.
